#### 33. Perceptions, Perschmeptions
--!>



<!--
It’s comfortable to play the idealist and pretend you don’t care what other 
people think about you. But, that’s a game. You can’t let yourself believe it. 
You _should_ care what other people think about you. Perception is reality. 
Get over it.

<!--
You probably know the old clichéd philosophical question, “If a tree falls in 
the forest but nobody is there to hear it fall, did it make a sound?” The 
correct answer to the question is, “Who cares?”
--!>



<!--
I mean, the fall probably made a sound. That’s not a very exciting answer on a 
metaphysical level, but it probably did. But, if nobody heard it fall, then the 
fact that it made a sound doesn’t really matter.
--!>



<!--
The same goes for your work. If you kick ass and no one is there to see, did 
you really kick ass? Who cares? No one.

<!--
In the subculture of Indian IT bureaucracy, I was amazed at how people just 
didn’t _get_ this simple truth. Almost everyone I dealt with there didn’t 
understand why it should matter that their managers, for example, knew what 
they were doing. If _you_ knew you were better than so and so, then it should 
be reflected in your performance reviews, ratings, and salary. They had fooled 
themselves into thinking that how other people perceived them was somehow 
subservient to the _truth_, whatever that was.
--!>



<!--
This truth thing...what is it? Who defines it? What is good and what is bad in 
an absolute sense?
--!>



<!--
The answer is that there is no absolute good or bad, at least not in terms
of judging who is better at a creative, knowledge worker job. How do you define 
what makes a good song? What about a good painting? You might have your own 
definitions, but I doubt I would agree with them.  They’re subjective.

*Performance appraisals are never objective.*
--!>



<!--
Horrible risk-averse human resources departments in horrible risk-averse 
companies spin their wheels chasing objective measures of the people they 
employ. Sometimes they even implement “objective” appraisal systems. All of my
team members in India thought _they_ wanted to be measured this way.  That’s 
because they had never experienced it before.
--!>




<!--
There is no way to objectively measure the quality of a knowledge worker, and 
there is no way to objectively measure the quality of their work. Go ahead. 
Disagree. Now think about your argument for a while. See the holes?
--!>



<!--
So, if the measure of your goodness at your company (or in the industry or the 
job market or wherever) is subjective, what does that mean?  That means you are 
always going to be measured based on someone else’s _perception_ of you. Your 
potential promotions or salary increases-even the decision of whether you 
should continue to be on the payroll at all—is completely dependent on the 
perceptions of others.
--!>



<!--
Subjectivity, being based on _personal_ taste, implies that you can’t count
on any two opinions being the same. Different people are impressed with 
different factors. Some people might like rigid structure, while others prefer 
loose, free creativity. Some may prefer to communicate via e-mail and others 
face to face or by phone. Some managers may like their employees to be 
aggressive, while others prefer them to act like subordinates. You say “Poh tay 
toh”—I say “poh tah toh.”
--!>



<!--
It doesn’t come down only to personal preference. People in different roles and 
relationships to you build their perceptions based on the qualities most 
important to making _that particular_ relationship work well. If I’m a project 
manager, the quality of your source code is a lot less important to me than the 
quality of your communications. If I’m a fellow programmer, your raw ability 
and creativity drive my perception of you more than, for example, your 
follow-through. But, if I’m your manager, raw ability is ultimately meaningless 
to me unless you actually _do_ something with it.
--!>



<!--
We’ve culturally trained ourselves to _perceive_ that managing perception is 
somehow a dirty and shameful activity. But, as you can see, managing perception 
is just practical. When you explicitly take note of the factors that drive 
other people’s perceptions of you, you more firmly discover how to make them 
happy customers. You’re not going to impress your nontechnical business client 
with your object-oriented design skills. You might be a design genius, but if 
you can’t communicate effectively and you don’t manage to complete your work on 
time, your customers will think you stink. It’s not their fault. You _do_ stink. 
Perceptions really do matter. They keep you employed (or unemployed). They get 
you promoted or get you stuck in the same job for years. They give you raises 
or lowball you on salary. The sooner you get over yourself and learn to manage 
perceptions, the sooner you’ll be on the right track.

##### Act on It!

<!--
Perceptions are driven by different factors, depending on who the audience is. 
Your mother doesn’t much care how well you can design object-oriented systems, 
but your teammates might.
--!>

<!--
Understanding what’s important in each of your relationships is an important 
part of building credible perceptions with those you interact with. Think about 
the different classes of relationships you generally have with people in the 
office. For example, you probably have teammates who do the same type of job 
you do. You also probably have a direct manager, and you may have one or more 
customers and a project manager.

<!--
Take these different groups (or whichever actually apply given the structure of 
your workplace), and list them. Next to each, write down which of your 
attributes is most likely to drive that group’s perception of you. 
Here’s an example:

<!-- Было оформленно как таблица
Group                                 Perception Drivers
Teammates                 Technical skills, social skills, teamwork.
Manager                   Leadership ability, customer focus, communication
                          skills, follow through, teamwork.
Customers                 Customer focus, communication skills,
                          follow through.
Project manager           Communication skills, follow through,
                          productivity, technical skills.
--!>


<!--
Put some thought into your own list. How might you change your behavior as a 
result of this list? In what ways have you already been adjusting your focus 
as you interact with each group?  In what ways have you not been appropriately 
adjusting your behavior?
