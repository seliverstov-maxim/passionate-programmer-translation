<!--
The days of the monosyllabic programmer grunt are over. If companies want to 
have difficulty communicating with their programmers, they’ll sit the 
programmers on a different continent and in a different time zone and 
communicate with them only via e-mail and phone.
--!>

Дни обычно просто ворчливого программиста закончились. Если компании хотят иметь сложности в коммуникациями с из программистами, они посадят программистов на разных континентах в разных часовых поясах и будут общаться с ними только через email и телефон.

<!--
So, the communication issue is an important one. On the list of tasks you need 
to do to stay gainfully employed, it might sound a little contrived, silly, or 
trivial. You might feel a bit like you’re back in high-school English class. 
That’s OK. You can actually pay attention this time.

Итак, вопрос коммуникации является важным. В списке задач тебе необходимо, чтобы остаться работником по найму, это может звучать немного надуманным, глупым или тривиальным. Ты можешь чувствовать как в школе на уроке английского языка. Это нормально. Ты можешь, в действительности, обратить внимание на этот раз.

<!--
We’ll get the most boring one over with first: grammar and spelling are 
important. You probably have a degree in an advanced subject like engineering 
or computer science, and here I am telling you to learn how to spell. 
_The nerve!_

But, at least here in the United States, we have a problem.

<!--
According to a report by the National Commission on Writing, more than half of 
all responding companies consider writing skills when making both hiring and 
promotion decisions. Forty percent of surveyed companies in the services sector 
said that a third or fewer of their new hires had the writing skills they 
desired.[^13]

<!--
When you really step back and take a look at the big picture, writing skills 
are both necessary _and_ are in short supply.

<!--
As you know, the world’s workforce is distributing itself globally. As this 
trend continues, there will come a time—for some, that time is now!—when _most_ 
workplace communication will take place in written form via either instant 
messaging or e-mail.
--!>



<!--
You’re going to be writing _a lot_. If so much of your job is going to involve 
writing, you better get good at it. More than ever, perceptions of you are 
going to be formed based on your writing ability. You may be a great coder, but 
if you can’t express yourself in words, you won’t be very effective on a 
distributed team.
--!>



<!--
The ability to write creates both a superficial perception of you and a real 
insight into how your mind works. If you can’t organize your thoughts in your 
mother tongue so that others can clearly understand them, how can we expect 
that you can do it in a programming language? The ability to shape an idea and 
lead a reader through a thought process to a logical conclusion is not much 
different from the ability to create a clear design and system implementation 
that future maintainers will be able to understand.

<!--
This isn’t all about being judged, either. If you have team members in 
different time zones and distant locations, writing may be the only way you 
have to explain what you’ve done, how you’ve designed something, or what your 
team members need to work on.
--!>



<!--
*You are what you can _explain_.*
--!>



<!--
Communication, especially through writing, is the bottleneck through which all 
your wonderful ideas must pass. You _are_ what you can _explain_.
--!>



<!--
Act on It!
--!>

<!--
  1. Start keeping a development diary. Write a little in it each day,
  explaining what you’ve been working on, justifying your design decisions, and 
  vetting tough technical or professional decisions.  Even though you are the 
  primary (or only—it’s up to you) audience, pay attention to the quality of 
  your writing and to your ability to clearly express yourself. Occasionally 
  reread old entries, and critique them. Adjust your new entries based on what 
  you liked and disliked about the old ones. Not only will your writing 
  improve, but you can also use this diary as a way to strengthen your 
  understanding of the decisions you make and as a place to refer to when you 
  need to understand how or why you did something previously.

<!--
  2. Learn to type. If you don’t already “touch type,” take a course or 
  download some software that will teach you. You’re more likely to be 
  comfortable and natural in your writing if you are comfortable with the input 
  method itself. Of course, with all this writing you’ll be doing, you’ll save 
  yourself some time by learning to type quickly.
