####Tip 32: Say It, Do It, Show It!
####Глава 32: Говори, делай, показывай!

The easiest way to never get anything done is to never commit anything.
Простейший способ никогда ничего не сделать, это не подтвержать ничего.
If you don't have a deadline, you dont have any pressure or much incentive to finish something.
Если у вас нет дедлайна, у вас нет достаточного давления или стимула закончить что-либо.
This is especially true when the *something* that needs to get done isn't 100 percent exciting.
Это особенно справедливо, когда то, *что* должно быть сделано не вдохновляет на 100 процентов.

Even a bad manager's instinct usually tells them that it's important to plan.
Даже плохому менеджеру инстинкт говорит о важности плаирования.
For some developers, the invocation of the word *plan* is cause for alarm.
Для некоторых разработчиков само слово *план* уже причина для беспокойства.
Endless meetings with pointy haired bosses creating reams of printed Microsoft Project plans that nobody understands or uses are valid cause for alarm.
Бесконечные встречи с островолосыми боссами, создающими массу планов, созданных в Microsoft Project, которые никто не понимает и не читает - весомая причина для беспокойства.
So, techies often overcompensate in our rebellion against perceived overplanning by constantly flying by the seat of our pants.
Так что технари часто компенсируют это восстанием против планирования, проявляя собственную инициативу.

Planning isn't such bad-tasting medicine that we should have to hold our breath to force down.
Планирование не столь неприятное лекарство, что нужно задерживать дыхание, чтобы проглотить его.
Planning can be a liberating experience.
Планирование может быть освобождающим опытом.
When you have too much to do, a plan can make the difference between confused ambiguity at the start of a workday and clear-headed confidence when attacking the tasks ahead.
Когда у вас слишком много дел. план может помочь отличить смущающую неопределенность в начале рабочего дня и ясную уверенность, когда вы беретесь за задачи.

Plans don't have to be big and drawn out.
Планы н едолжны быть большими и выверены.
A list in a text document or e-mail is perfectly fine.
Списка или почтового сообщения совершенно достаточно.
Plans don't have to cover a large span of time.
Планы не должны покрывать большой промежуток времени.
Being able to start the day and answer the question "What are you going to do today?" is a great first step.
Иметь возможность начать день и ответить на вопрос "Что я собираюсь сделать сегодня?" - замечательный первый шаг.
I know many people whose days stay so hectic that they would almost always fail this test.
Я знаю много людей, чьи дни настолько беспокойны, что они проваливат этот тест.
A good first step would be to find time this afternoon and list everything you want to get done on next workday and arrange them in priority order.
Хорошим первым шагом будет найти время вечером и составить список всего, что вы хотите выполнить на следующий рабочий день и отсортировать его в порядке приоритетных дел.
Try to be realistic about what can fill a day, though you're likely to be wrong and specifically likely to overcommit yourself.
Попытайтесь быть реалистом в отношении того, чем будет наполнен день, несмотря на то, что вы скорее всего ошибетесь и преувеличите этот список.

You can be as detailed or as loose as you want with your one-day plan.
Вы можете быть настолько детальным или расслабленным, насколько хотите в своем однодневном плане.
I had a roommate in college named Chris who would wake up every morning and, even at risk of being late for his first class, would meticulously plan out his day, specifically focusing in his piano practice schedule (he was a jazz piano major).
У меня был сосед по комнате в колледже по имени Крис, он просыпался утром и, даже рискуя опоздать на первое занятие, педантично планировал свой день, особенно фокусируясь на расписании своих занятий по фортепиано (он был джазовым пианистом).
His schedule was fairly rigid already with the selection of classes he had to attend.
Его расписание было уже достаточно жестким  с тем набором классов, которые он был намере посещать.
Still, Chris would actually plan down to how he was going to use the fifteen minutes *between* classes to fit in practice routines that could be done quickly.
Однако, Крис мог спланировать свои пятнадцати минутные *между* занятиями, заполнив их тем, что могло быть сделано быстро.
Many of his classes were in the same building, so it was common to have plenty of leisure time in between them for some quick socializing or grabbing a drink from the vending machines. Chris would be cramming in scales or ear training while the rest of us were sitting around waiting for the next class to start. He would even divide his schedule into multiply three-to-five-minute segments, so he could fit more than one practice exercise into a given ten-minute period. Chris ended up becoming one of the most respected musicians in our city. Natural talent had soemthing to do with it, of course, but I've since held belief that he planned and executed his way into the musical elite.

So, you've made your plan. It may not be as detailed as Chris's, but it's enough to answer the question of what you're going to do with your day. When you get to work tomorrow, pull out the list and start on the first item. Work through the list until you go to lunch, and then pick up where you left off and try to finish the list.

As you complete each item on the list, mark it DONE. Use capital letters. Say the word, *done*. Be happy. At the end of the day, look at yor list of DONE stuff and feel like you've accomplished something. Not only did you know what you were going to do today, but now you know what you've *done*.

If you didn't get everything done, don't worry about it. You knew you weren't going to be right about how much would fit in a day anyway. Just move the incomplete items from today (if they're still relevant) onto tomorrow's list, and start the process again. It's a stimulating process. It's a rhythmic. It allows you to divide your days and weeks into a series of small victories, each one propelling you to the next. You'll find that not only does it give you visibility into what you're accomplishing, but you'll actually get *more done* than if you weren't watching things so closely. 

Having established a rhythm of plan and attack, you are already to start thinking in terms of weeks and even months. Of course, the larger the time span you're planning for, the higher level your plan should get. Think of week and day plans as being tactical battle plans, with thirty-, sixty-, and ninety-day plans focusing on more strategic goals that you want to accomplish.

The very act of thinking about what you want to have accomplished in ninety days is something unnatural for software soldiers on the field. We are tactical people. Forcing yourself to imagine an end state for your system, your team's processes, or your career after ninety days will cause things to surface that you never expected. The view from above the field shows us very different things than the view from the ground. It will be difficult at first, but stick with it. Like all good skills, it gets easier with practice, and the benefits will be visible to both you and those who work with you (even if they don't know that you are doing it).

You should start communicating the plans to your management. The best time to start communicating the plans is after you have executed at least one cycle of the plan. And - this is an important point - start doing it before they ask you to do it. No manager in his or her right mind would be unhappy to receive a *succinct* weekly e-mail from an employee starting what was accomplished in the past week and what they plan to do in the next. Receiving this kind of regular message unsolicited is a manager's dream.

Start by communicating week by week. When you've gotten comfortable with this process, start working in your thirty-, sixty-, and ninety-day plans. On the longer views, stick to high-level, impactful progress you plan to make on projects or systems you maintain. Always state these long-term plans as proposals to your manager, and ask for feedback. Over time, these anticipation attempts will require less tweaking from your managers as you learn which items usually go unedited and which are the subject of more thrashing.

The most critical factor to keep in mind with everything that goes onto a plan is that it should always be accounted for later. Every item must be either visibly completed, delayed, removed, or replaced. No items should go unaccounted for. If items show up on a plan and are never mentioned again, people will stop trusting your  plans, and the plans and you will counteract the effectiveness of planning. Even if the outcome is *bad*, you should communicate it as such. We all make mistakes. The way to differenciate yourself is to address your mistakes or inabilities publicly and ask for help solving them. 

Consistently tracing tasks on a plan will create the desereved impression that no important work is getting lost in the mix.

Get this process going, and suddenly in the eyes of your management you have exposed your strategic side. Creating and executing plans shows that you are not just a robot typing code, but you are a *leader*. It's this kind of independent productivity that companies need as they reduce overhead.

A final benefit of communicating in terms of plans is that your commitments become more credible. If you say what you're going to do and then you do it and show that it's done, you develop a reputation for being a *doer*. With credibility comes influence. Imagine you want to introduce a new process, such as an agile development practice,[14] into an organization or you want to bring in a new technology. With the proven ability to make and meet commitments, you'll be granted more leeway to try new things. 

In our Bangalore software center, we had a team that had been working night shifts for more than a year. Of the seven members on the team, two were always on the night shift. They rotated weekly, so every third or fourth week, each team member would switch to a 7 p.m. to 3 a.m. schedule. The team was getting frustrated and burnt out, saying that they almost constantly felt jet-lagged. But, the team was playing a critical support role, and the team's U.S.-based internal customers were convinced they couldn't get by without live real-time help from the group in Bangalore. 

So, the team put together a plan of attack. They looked at their various support processes and accociated measurements and crafted a plan to both switch back to a single-day shift *and* to make significant improvements in their customer experience, simulaneously. As acting operations leader of the software center, I helped them fine-tune their plan and was present (as moral support) fro the formal proposal they made to their manager in the United States.

They knew this was going to be a touchy subject for their manager, who had to answer to his U.S.-based customers in person. There was naturally much trepidation among the team members as the meeting started. However, the team's manager was so impressed that he immediately and happily signed off on the proposal, and the team put its plan into action. Within weeks, the jet lag was over, and everyone was back on day shifts.

The solidity of their plan for how to not only deal with the change in work hours but how they were going to strategically improve the performance of their team inspired great confidence in the leaders and, eventually, their customers. The team's manager used the plan when communicating the change with his customers. And, the team followed through. Within months, the team was running at a new level of efficiency. They've since gained such credibility and confidence that they have taken more and more ownership and independence over the workings of theri team.

The team used its plan as a concrete to a problem. They came to their manager not with complaints but with proposed solutions. 

Your leaders want you to have independence and ownership. Making, executing, and communicating plans will help you attain both.
